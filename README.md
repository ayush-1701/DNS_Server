Why is DNS Server Used?
Each website/domain name has an IP address, which displays its accurate location on the internet. To access this address rather than typing IPs we type the Domain Name which is easier to remember. The DNS is the medium to that!

The DNS can retrieve a website and display it in a your browser.
